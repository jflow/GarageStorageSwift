// This is an example of a "simple type" or struct, that is not a reference type, that can still participate in GarageStorage, without needing to be a Mappable type, a date, or an atomic type (like an integer).
struct SwiftAddress {
    
    var street: String
    var city: String
    var zip: String

// In order to store this as a data member of another object in GarageStorage, it must conform to Codable.
extension SwiftAddress: Codable { }

// In order to store this as a root type, it must conform to either
// Hashable, or the reference (class) Mappable type.
// Since this is a simple type, we go with Hashable.
